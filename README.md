- 👋 Hi, I’m @PandaDrawz
- 👀 I’m interested in anime, drawing, animating, acting, voice acting, and coding (of course because why else would I be here lol)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Russian, coding, how to animate, and anatomy.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything for now.
- 📫 You can reach me using my twitter (@arabella_berg), or email (arabellaberg883@gmail.com)
